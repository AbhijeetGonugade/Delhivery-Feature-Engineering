# Delhivery-Feature-Engineering
The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering pipelines: 
• Clean, sanitize and manipulate data to get useful features out of raw fields 
• Make sense out of the raw data and help the data science team to build forecasting models on it

In this project 
Implemented feature engineering at Delhivery, enhancing data preprocessing and
